# Store-Manager

## Introduction
A store manager needs to build an organized store for his inventory and then use that store to fill customer orders. This manager has a unique style of managing his store and taking orders. He/she categorizes the inventory by type and fills orders by the types of items that are requested. If the store runs out of a certain type of item the customer can choose to either accept the part of their order that can be filled or have their order cancelled.

You will be given two data files (examples given) that you will need to use to build your store and your orders and the results of filling the orders using the store will be written to a results file.

## Objectives
Use of STL Vectors, Stacks and Queues will all be covered
